            What&#39;s interesting is that gamification is not a new concept. While the term may have been coined in more 
            <br/>
            recent times, the concept has existed in many areas of life for as long as civilisation has existed. If you 
            <br/>
            remember watching Mary Poppins, she sums up gamification quite nicely with the quote

            &#34;In every job that

          She was onto something here. Mary Poppins knew all the way back in the 1960s that anything could be turned

            Back in the early 1900s, if you were a Boy Scout you could obtain real badges and ranks, a tradition that is still 
            <br/>
            carried out today. However as video games started to take off, we saw educational video games then become 
            <br/>
            popular in the 1970s and 80s. You may remember such games as &#39;Where in the World is Carmen San Diego&#39;, 
            <br/>
            ‘Reader Rabbit&#39; and &#39;Math Blaster’. These games were forms of entertainment that were built for serious 
            <br/>
            purposes, to educate players.

            Foursquare is an example of social gamification. If you checked into a location, you would receive points.

            Check in to a new location, you hadn&#39;t visited before and you would receive even more points. You could then 
            <br/>
            compare the number of points you had on a leaderboard with friends and you could also receive badges for
